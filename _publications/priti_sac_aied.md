## Abstract


This paper presents a comparison of two instructional strategies
meant to help learners better comprehend code and learn program-
ming concepts: reading code examples annotated with expert ex-
planation (worked-out examples) versus scaffolded self-explanation
of code examples using an automated system (Intelligent Tutoring
System). A randomized controlled trial study was conducted with
90 university students who were assigned to either the control
group (reading worked-out examples, a passive strategy) or the ex-
perimental group where participants were asked to self-explain and
received help, if needed, in the form of questions from the tutoring
system( scaffolded self-explanation, an interactive strategy).
We found that students with low prior knowledge in the ex-
perimental condition had significantly higher learning gains than
students with high prior knowledge. However, in the control condi-
tion, this distinction in learning outcomes based on prior knowledge
was not observed. We also analyzed the effect of self-efficacy on
learning gains and the nature of self-explanation. Low self-efficacy
students learn almost twice as much in the interactive condition
versus the passive condition although the difference was not signif-
icant probably because of low sample size. We also found that high
self-efficacy students tend to provide more relational explanations
whereas low self-efficacy students provide more multi-structural
or line-by-line explanation
