## Abstract

Self-explanations could increase studentâ€™s comprehension in complex domains; however, it works most efficiently with a human tutor who could provide corrections and scaffolding. In this paper, we present our attempt to scale up the use of self-explanations in learning programming by delegating assessment and scaffolding of explanations to an intelligent tutor. To assess our approach, we performed a randomized control trial experiment that measured the impact of automatic assessment and scaffolding of self-explanations on code comprehension and learning. The study results indicate that low-prior knowledge students in the experimental condition learn more compared to high-prior knowledge in the same condition but such difference is not observed in a similar grouping of students based on prior knowledge in the control condition.
