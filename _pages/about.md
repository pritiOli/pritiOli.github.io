I am a graduate student pursuing my PhD in computer science under the supervision of my Professor Vasile Rus in Language and Information Processing lab at the University of Memphis.

## Professional

Before joining the University of Memphis I worked as a full time software engineer at Zakipoint Health.

## Personal

In my free time I like to explore the outdoor spaces indulging myself into physical activities like cycling, hiking, trekking. As much as I love being outdoors, I love the confort of the indoors to read a good book or practise yoga and minfulness.
